<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN I met the signora at
the tram station that May
morning she was evidently
troubled about something which was
only partly explained by her murmured
excuse, &ldquo;a sleepless night.&rdquo;
We were to cross the Campagna to
one of the little towns in the Albanian
hills, where young Maironi was
temporarily stationed with his regiment.
If we had good luck and happened
upon an indulgent officer, the
mother might get sight of her boy
for a few minutes. All the way over
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>the flowering Campagna, with the
blue hills swimming on the horizon
before us, the signora was unusually
taciturn, seemingly indifferent to the
beauty of the day, and the wonderful
charm of the Italian spring, to
which she was always so lyrically responsive
on our excursions. When a
great dirigible rose into the blue air
above our heads, like a huge silver
fish, my companion gave a slight
start, and I divined what was in her
mind&mdash;the imminence of war, which
had been threatening to engulf Italy
for many months. It was that fear
which had destroyed her customary
gayety, the indomitable cheerfulness
of the true Latin mother that she
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is coming,&rdquo; she sighed, glancing
up at the dirigible. &ldquo;It will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>be long now before we shall know&mdash;only
a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to the ignorant optimism of
my protest she smiled sadly, with
the fatalism that women acquire in
countries of conscription. It was futile
to combat with mere theory and
logic this conviction of a mother&rsquo;s
heart. Probably the signora had overheard
some significant word which
to her sensitive intelligence was more
real, more positive than all the subtle
reasonings at the Consulta. The
sphinx-like silence of ministers and
diplomats had not been broken: there
was nothing new in the &ldquo;situation.&rdquo;
The newspapers were as wordily
empty of fact as ever. And yet this
morning for the first time Signora
Maironi seemed convinced against
her will that war was inevitable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<p>These last days there had been a
similar change in the mood of the
Italian public, not to be fully explained
by any of the rumors flying
about Rome, by the sudden exodus
of Germans and Austrians, by anything
other than that mysterious
sixth sense which enables humanity,
like wild animals, to apprehend unknown
dangers. Those whose lives
and happiness are at stake seem to
divine before the blow falls what is
about to happen.... For the first
time I began to believe that Italy
might really plunge into the deep
gulf at which her people had so long
gazed in fascinated suspense. There
are secret signs in a country like
Italy, where much is hidden from
the stranger. Signora Maironi knew.
She pointed to some soldiers waiting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>at a station and observed: &ldquo;They
have their marching-kit, and they
are going north!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We talked of other things while the
tram crept far up above the Campagna
and slowly circled the green
hillsides, until we got down at the
dirty little gray town of Genzano,
where Enrico Maironi&rsquo;s regiment had
been sent. There were no barracks.
The soldiers were quartered here
and there in old stone buildings.
We could see their boyish faces at
the windows and the gray uniform
of the <i>granatieri</i> in the courtyards.
It seemed a hopeless task to find the
signora&rsquo;s boy, until a young lieutenant
to whom the mother appealed
offered to accompany us in
our search. He explained that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>soldiers had to be kept shut up in
their quarters because they were
stoned by the inhabitants when they
appeared on the streets. They were
a tough lot up here in the hills, he
said, and they were against the war.
That was why, I gathered, the grenadiers
had been sent thither from
Rome, to suppress all &ldquo;demonstrations&rdquo;
that might embarrass the
government at this moment.</p>

<p>The citizens of Genzano certainly
looked ugly. They were dirty and
poor, and scowled at the young officer.
The little town, for all its heavenly
situation, seemed dreary and
sad. The word &ldquo;<i>socialismo</i>&rdquo; scrawled
on the stone walls had been half
erased by the hand of authority. War
meant to these people more taxes and
fewer men to work the fields.... The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>young lieutenant liked to air his
French; smoking one of the few good
cigars I had left, he talked freely
while we waited for Enrico to emerge
from the monastery where we finally
located him. It would be war, of
course, he said. There was no other
way. Before it might have been
doubtful, but now that the Germans
had been found over in Tripoli and
German guns, too, what could one
do? Evidently the lieutenant welcomed
almost anything that would
take the grenadiers from Genzano!</p>

<p>Then Enrico came running out of
the great gate, as nice a looking lad
of nineteen as one could find anywhere,
even in his soiled and mussed
uniform, and Enrico had no false
shame about embracing his mother
in the presence of his officer and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>the comrades who were looking down
on us enviously from the windows
of the old monastery. The lieutenant
gave the boy three hours&rsquo; liberty to
spend with us and, saluting politely,
went back to the post.</p>

<p>With Enrico between us we wandered
up the hill toward the green
lake in the bowl of the ancient
crater. Signora Maironi kept tight
hold of her lad, purring over him in
French and Italian&mdash;the more intimate
things in Italian&mdash;turning as
mothers will from endearment to
gentle scolding. Why did he not
keep himself tidier? Surely he had
the needles and thread his sister
Bianca had given him the last time
he was at home. And how was the
ear? Had he carried out the doctor&rsquo;s
directions? Which it is needless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>to say Enrico had not. The
signora explained to me that the
boy was in danger of losing the hearing
of one ear because of the careless
treatment the regimental doctor had
given him when he had a cold. She
did not like to complain of the military
authorities: of course they could
not bother with every little trouble
a soldier had in a time like this, but
the loss of his hearing would be a
serious handicap to the boy in earning
his living....</p>

<p>It seemed that Enrico had not yet
breakfasted, and, although it was
only eleven, I insisted on putting
forward the movable feast of continental
breakfast, and we ordered
our <i>colazione</i> served in the empty
garden of the little inn above the
lake. While Enrico ate and discussed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>with me the prospects of war, the
signora looked the boy all over
again, feeling his shoulders beneath
the loose uniform to see whether he
had lost flesh after the thirty-mile
march from Rome under a hot sun.
It was much as an American mother
might examine her offspring after
his first week at boarding-school,
only more intense. And Enrico was
very much like a clean, hearty, lovable
schoolboy, delighted to be let
out from authority and to talk like
a man with another man. He was
confident Italy would be in the war&mdash;oh,
very sure! And he nodded his
head at me importantly. His captain
was a capital fellow, really like
a father to the men, and the captain
had told them&mdash;but he pulled
himself up suddenly. After all, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>was a foreigner, and must not hear
what the captain had said. But he
let me know proudly that his regiment
the <i>granatieri</i> of Sardinia, had
received the promise that they would
be among the first to go to the front.
The mother&rsquo;s fond eyes contracted
slightly with pain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After our breakfast Enrico took me
into the garden of the old monastery
where other youthful grenadiers
were loafing on the grass under the
trees or writing letters on the rough
table among the remains of food.
Some of the squad had gone to the
lake for a swim; I could hear their
shouts and laughter far below. Presently
the signora, who had been
barred at the gate by the old Franciscan,
hurried down the shady path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;that
he could just look the other way and
avoid sin. Then I slipped through
the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So with her hand on her recaptured
boy we strolled through the
old gardens as far as the stable
where the soldiers slept. The floor
was littered with straw, which, with
an overcoat, Enrico assured me,
made a capital bed. The food was
good enough. They got four cents a
day, which did not go far to buy
cigarettes and postage-stamps, but
they would be paid ten cents a day
when they were at war!...</p>

<p>At last we turned into the highroad
arched with old trees that led
down to the tramway. Enrico&rsquo;s leave
was nearly over. All the glory of the
spring day poured forth from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>flowering hedges, where bees hummed
and birds sang. Enrico gathered a
great bunch of yellow heather, which
his mother wanted to take home.
&ldquo;Little Bianca will like it so much
when she hears her brother picked
it,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Bianca thinks he
is a hero already, the dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we reached the car-tracks
we sat on a mossy wall and chatted.
In a field across the road an old gray
mare stood looking steadfastly at
her small foal, which was asleep in
the high grass at her feet. The old
mare stood patiently for many minutes
without once cropping a bit of
grass, lowering her head occasionally
to sniff at the little colt. Her attitude
of absorbed contemplation, of perfect
satisfaction in her ungainly offspring
made me laugh&mdash;it was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>exactly like the signora&rsquo;s. At last the
little fellow woke, got somehow on
his long legs, and shaking a scrubby
tail went gambolling off down the
pasture, enjoying his coltish world.
The old mare followed close behind
with eyes only for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at him!&rdquo; the signora exclaimed
pointing to the ridiculous
foal. &ldquo;How nice he is! Oh, how beautiful
youth always is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up admiringly at her
tall, handsome Enrico, who had
just brought her another bunch of
heather. The birds were singing like
mad in the fields; some peasants
passed with their laden donkeys;
I smoked contemplatively, while
mother and son talked family gossip
and the signora went all over
her boy again for the fourth time....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>Yes, youth is beautiful, surely,
but there seemed something horribly
pathetic about it all in spite of
the loveliness of the May morning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three hours came to an end.
Enrico rose and saluted me formally.
He was so glad to have seen me; I
was very good to bring his mother
all the way from Rome; and he and
the comrades would much enjoy my
excellent cigarettes. &ldquo;<i>A riverderci!</i>&rdquo;
Then he turned to his mother and
without any self-consciousness bent
to her open arms....</p>

<p>When the signora joined me farther
down the road she was clear-eyed
but sombre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you understand,&rdquo; she said
softly, &ldquo;how when I have him in
my arms and think of all I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>done for him, his education, his long
sickness, all, all&mdash;and what he means
to me and his father and little Bianca&mdash;and
then I think how in one
moment it may all be over for always,
all that precious life&mdash;O God
what are women made for!... We
shall have to hurry, my friend, to
get to the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced back once more at the
slim figure just going around the
bend of the road at a run, so as not
to exceed his leave&mdash;a mere boy and
such a nice boy, with his brilliant,
eager eyes, so healthy and clean and
joyous, so affectionate, so completely
what any mother would adore. And
he might be going &ldquo;up north&rdquo; any
day now to fight the Austrians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signora,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;do you believe
in war?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They all say this war has to be,&rdquo;
she said dully. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!...
It is a hard world to understand!...
I try to remember that I am only
one of hundreds of thousands of
Italian women.... I hope I shall
see him once more before they take
him away. My God!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon the expert who had
been sent to Rome by a foreign
newspaper to watch the critical situation
carefully put down his empty
teacup and pronounced his verdict:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this time it looks to me
really like war. They have gone too
far to draw back. Some of them think
they are likely to get a good deal out
of the war with a small sacrifice&mdash;everybody
likes a bargain, you know!...
Then General Cadorna, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>say, is a very ambitious man, and
this is his chance. A successful campaign
would make him.... But I
don&rsquo;t know. It would be quite a
risk, quite a risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I thought, quite a risk for the
conscript mothers!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>

<p>The politician came to Rome and
delivered his prudent advice, and
the quiescent people began to growl.
The ministers resigned: the public
growled more loudly.... During
the turbulent week that followed,
while Italy still hesitated, I saw
Enrico Maironi a number of times.
Indeed, his frank young face with
the sparkling black eyes is mingled
with all my memories of those tense
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>days when the streets of Rome were
vocal with passionate crowds, when
soldiers barred the thoroughfares,
and no one knew whether there
would be war with Austria or revolution.</p>

<p>One night, having been turned out
of the CafÃ© Nazionale when the
troops cleared the Corso of the mob
that threatened the Austrian embassy,
I wandered through the agitated
city until I found myself in
the quarter where the Maironis lived,
and called at their little home to
hear if they had had news of the
boy. There was light in the dining-room,
though it was long past the
hour when even the irresponsible
Maironis took their irregular dinner.
As I entered I could see in the light
of the single candle three faces intently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>focused on a fourth&mdash;Enrico&rsquo;s,
with a preoccupation that
my arrival scarcely disturbed. They
made me sit down and hospitably
opened a fresh bottle of wine. The
boy had just arrived unexpectedly,
his regiment having been recalled to
Rome that afternoon. He was travel-stained,
with a button off his military
coat which his sister was sewing
on while he ate. He looked tired but
excited, and his brilliant eyes lighted
with welcome as he accepted one of
my Turkish cigarettes with the air
of a young worldling and observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it <i>is</i> coming&mdash;sooner
than we expected!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a note of boyish triumph
in his voice as he went on to
explain again for my benefit how
his captain&mdash;a really good fellow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>though a bit severe in little things&mdash;had
let him off for the evening to
see his family. He spoke of his officer
exactly as my own boy might speak
of some approved schoolmaster. Signor
Maironi, who in his post at the
war office heard things before they
got into the street, looked very
grave and said little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are glad to have him back
in Rome, at any rate!&rdquo; I said to the
signora.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders expressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rome is the first step on a long
journey,&rdquo; she replied sombrely.</p>

<p>The silent tensity of the father&rsquo;s
gaze, fastened on his boy, became
unbearable. I followed the signora,
who had strolled through the open
door to the little terrace and stood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>looking blankly into the night. Far
away, somewhere in the city, rose a
clamor of shouting people, and swift
footsteps hurried past in the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will kill his father, if anything
happens to him!&rdquo; she said slowly,
as if she knew herself to be the
stronger. &ldquo;You see he chose the
grenadiers for Enrico because that
regiment almost never leaves Rome:
it stays with the King. And now the
King is going to the front, they say&mdash;it
will be the first of all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night may be his last time at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I said, seeking for the
futile crumb of comfort, &ldquo;they will
take Giolitti&rsquo;s advice, and there will
be no war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Enrico, who had followed us from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>the dining-room, caught the remark
and cried with youthful conviction:
&ldquo;That Giolitti is a traitor&mdash;he has
been bought by the Germans!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Giolitti!&rdquo; little Bianca echoed
scornfully, arching her black brows.
Evidently the politician had lost his
popularity among the youth of Italy.
Within the dining-room I could see
the father sitting alone beside the
candle, his face buried in his hands.
Bianca caressed her brother&rsquo;s shoulder
with her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going, too!&rdquo; she said to me
with a little smile. &ldquo;I shall join the
Red Cross&mdash;I begin my training
to-morrow, eh, <i>mamma mia</i>?&rdquo; And
she threw a glance of childish defiance
at the signora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Bianca is growing up fast!&rdquo;
I laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They take them all except the
cripples,&rdquo; the signora commented
bitterly, &ldquo;even the girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am a woman,&rdquo; Bianca protested,
drawing away from Enrico
and raising her pretty head. &ldquo;I shall
get the hospital training and go up
north, too&mdash;to be near &rsquo;Rico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something surely had come to the
youth of this country when girls
like Bianca Maironi spoke with such
assurance of going forth from the
home into the unknown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sicuro!</i>&rdquo; She nodded her head
to emphasize what I suspected had
been a moot point between mother
and daughter. The signora looked
inscrutably at the girl for a little
while, then said quietly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;most
ten, Enrico.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy unclasped Bianca&rsquo;s tight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>little hands, kissed his mother and
father, gave me the military salute
... and we could hear him running
fast down the street. The signora
blew out the sputtering candle and
closed the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going, too!&rdquo; Bianca exclaimed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poet was coming to Rome.
After the politician, close on his
heels, the poet, fresh from his triumph
at the celebration of Quarto,
where with his flaming allegory he
had stirred the youth of Italy to
their depths! A few henchmen, waiting
for the leader&rsquo;s word, had met
Giolitti; all Rome, it seemed to
me, was turning out to greet the
poet. They had poured into the
great square before the terminus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>station from every quarter. The
packed throng reached from the
dark walls of the ancient baths
around the splashing fountain, into
the radiating avenues, and up to the
portico of the station itself, which
was black with human figures. It
was a quiet, orderly, well-dressed
crowd that swayed back and forth,
waiting patiently hour after hour&mdash;the
train was very late&mdash;to see the
poet&rsquo;s face, to hear, perhaps, his
word of courage for which it thirsted.</p>

<p>There were soldiers everywhere, as
usual. I looked in vain for the familiar
uniform of the <i>granatieri</i>, but
the gray-coated boyish figures seemed
all alike. In the midst of the press
I saw the signora and Bianca, whose
eyes were also wandering after the
soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You came to welcome D&rsquo;Annunzio?&rdquo;
I queried, knowing the good
woman&rsquo;s prejudices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; the signora retorted with
curling lip. &ldquo;Bianca brought me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have been to the Red
Cross,&rdquo; the girl flashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rome welcomes the poet as though
he were royalty,&rdquo; I remarked, standing
on tiptoe to sweep with a glance
the immense crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> will not go to the front&mdash;he
will just talk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enrico is here somewhere,&rdquo; Bianca
explained. &ldquo;They told us so at
the barracks. We have looked all
about and mamma has asked so
many officers. We haven&rsquo;t seen him
since that first night. He has been
on duty all day in the streets, doing
<i>pichett &rsquo;armato</i>, ... I wish Giolitti
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>would go back home. If he doesn&rsquo;t
go soon, he&rsquo;ll find out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her white teeth came together
grimly, and she made a significant
little gesture with her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s mamma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The signora had caught sight of
another promising uniform and was
talking with the kindly officer who
wore it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His company is inside the station,&rdquo;
she explained when she rejoined us,
&ldquo;and we can never get
in there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have left if Bianca had
not restrained her. The girl wanted
to see the poet. Presently the night
began to fall, the still odorous May
night of Rome. The big arc-lamps
shone down upon the crowded faces.
Suddenly there was a forward swaying,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>shouts and cheers from the station.
A little man&rsquo;s figure was being
carried above the eager crowd. Then
a motor bellowed for free passage
through the human mass. A wave of
song burst from thousands of throats,
Mameli&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Inno.&rdquo; A little gray face
passed swiftly. The poet had come
and gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Bianca exclaimed, taking
my hand firmly and pulling the signora
on the other side. And she hurried
us on with the streaming crowd
through lighted streets toward the
Pincian hill, in the wake of the poet&rsquo;s
car. The crowd had melted from
about the station and was pouring
into the Via Veneto. About the little
fountain of the Tritone it had
massed again, but persistent Bianca
squirmed through the yielding figures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>dragging us with her until we
were wedged tight in the mass
nearly opposite the Queen Mother&rsquo;s
palace.</p>

<p>The vast multitude that reached
into the shadow of the night were
cheering and singing. Their shouts
and songs must have reached even
the ears of the German ambassador
at the Villa Malta a few blocks
away. The signora had forgotten her
grenadier, her dislike of the poet, and
for the moment was caught up in
the emotion of the crowd. Bianca
was singing the familiar hymn....
Suddenly there was a hush; light
fell upon the upturned faces from an
opened window on a balcony in the
Hotel Regina. The poet stood forth
in the band of yellow light and
looked down upon the dense throng
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>beneath. In the stillness his words
began to fall, very slowly, very
clearly, as if each was a graven message
for his people. And the Roman
youth all about me swayed and
sighed, seizing each colored word,
divining its heroic symbol, drinking
thirstily the ardor of the poet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light has not wholly gone
from the Aurelian wall ... fifty
years ago at this hour the leader of
the Thousand and his heroic company....
We will not be a museum,
an inn, a water-color in Prussian
blue!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The double line of soldiers behind
us had forgotten their formation
and were pressing forward to catch
each word. The signora was gazing
at the man with fascinated eyes.
Bianca&rsquo;s little hand tightened unconsciously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>on mine, and her lips
parted in a smile. The poet&rsquo;s words
were falling into her eager heart.
He was speaking for her, for all the
ardent youth of Italy:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Viva! Viva Roma senza onta!
Viva la grande Ã© pura Italia!...</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice ceased: for one moment
there was complete silence; then a
cheer that was half a sigh broke
from the crowd. But the blade of
light faded, the poet was gone.
When at last I got the Maironis
into a cab there were bright tears
in Bianca&rsquo;s eyes and the mother&rsquo;s
face was troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it has to be,&rdquo; the signora
murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Bianca echoed sharply,
raising her little head defiantly.
&ldquo;What else could Italy do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The streets were rapidly emptying.
Some companies of infantry
that had been policing the city all
day marched wearily past. Bianca
jumped up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>granatieri</i>! And there&rsquo;s
&rsquo;Rico&rsquo;s captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sympathetic cab-driver pulled
up his horse while the soldiers
tramped by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rico, &rsquo;Rico!&rdquo; the girl called softly
to the soldiers.</p>

<p>A hand went up, and the boy gave
us a luminous smile as his file swung
past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen him again!&rdquo; the
mother said hungrily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poet spoke the next day, and
the next, to the restless people who
waited hour after hour in the street
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>before his hotel. Having found its
voice&mdash;a voice that revealed its inner
heart&mdash;young Italy clamored for
action. The fret of Rome grew
louder hourly; soldiers cordoned the
main streets, while Giolitti waited,
the ambassadors flitted back and
forth to the Consulta, the King took
counsel with his advisers. I looked
for young Maironi&rsquo;s face among
the lines of troops barring passage
through the streets. It seemed as
if he might be called at any moment
to do his soldier&rsquo;s duty here
in Rome!</p>

<p>All day long and half the night the
cavalry stood motionless before the
Church of Santa Maria Maggiore,
ready to clear away the mobs that
prowled about the corner of Via
Cavour, where Giolitti lived. Once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>they charged. It was the night the
poet appeared at the Costanzi Theatre.
The narrow street was full of
shouting people as I drove to the
theatre with the Maironis. Suddenly
there was the ugly sound of horses&rsquo;
feet on concrete walks, shrieks and
wild rushes for safety in doorways
and alleys. As our cab whisked
safely around a corner the cavalry
came dashing past, their hairy plumes
streaming out from the metal helmets,
their ugly swords high in the
air. The signora&rsquo;s face paled. Perhaps
she was thinking, as I was,
that there might be one thing worse
than war with Austria, and that
would be revolution. Bianca exclaimed
scornfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had better be fighting Italy&rsquo;s
enemies!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not yet enemies,&rdquo; I
ventured.</p>

<p>She gave a little shrug of her
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fever within the vast auditorium
seemed to bear out the girl&rsquo;s
words. Here was no &ldquo;rabble of the
piazza,&rdquo; to repeat the German ambassador&rsquo;s
sneer, but well-to-do Roman
citizens. For three hours they
shouted their hatred of Teuton, sang
patriotic hymns, cried defiance of
the politician Giolitti, who would
keep the nation safely bound in its
old alliance. &ldquo;<i>Fuori i barbari!...
Giolitti traditore!</i>&rdquo; One grizzled Roman
hurled in my ears: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drink
his blood, the traitor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the little poet entered his
flower-wreathed box every one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>cheered and waved to him. He stood
looking down on the passionate human
sea beneath him, then slowly
plucked the red flowers from a great
bunch of carnations that some one
handed him and threw them one by
one far out into the cheering throng.
One floated downward straight into
Bianca&rsquo;s eager hand. She snatched
it, kissed the flower, and looked upward
into the poet&rsquo;s smiling face....</p>

<p>He recited the suppressed stanzas
of a war-poem, the slow, rhythmic
lines falling like the red flowers into
eager hearts. The signora was standing
on her seat beside Bianca, clasping
her arm, and tears gathered
slowly in her large, wistful eyes,
tears of pride and sadness.... Out
in the still night once more from
that storm of passion we walked on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>silently through empty streets. &ldquo;He
believes it&mdash;he is right,&rdquo; the signora
sighed. &ldquo;Italy also must do her
part!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Bianca said quickly,
&ldquo;and she will!... See there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl pointed to a heap of stones
freshly upturned in the street. It
was the first barricade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our soldiers must not fight each
other,&rdquo; she said gravely, and glanced
again over her shoulder at the barricade....</p>

<p>In front of Santa Maria the tired
cavalry sat their horses, and a double
line of infantry was drawn across the
Via Cavour before the Giolitti home.
The boys were slouching over their
rifles; evidently, whatever play there
had been in this picket duty had
gone out of it. Suddenly Bianca and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>her mother ran down the line. &ldquo;Maironi,
Maironi!&rdquo; I heard some of the
soldiers calling softly, and there was
a shuffle in the ranks. Enrico was
shoved forward to the front in comradely
fashion. Mother and sister
chatted with the boy, and presently
Bianca came dashing back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat
all day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found a cafÃ© still open and
loaded ourselves with rolls, chocolate,
and cigarettes, which Bianca
distributed to the weary soldiers
while the young lieutenant tactfully
strolled to the other end of the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of keeping them here
all day without food!&rdquo; the signora
grumbled as we turned away. The
boys, shoving their gifts into pockets
and mouths, straightened up as their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>officer came back down the line.
&ldquo;They might as well be at war,&rdquo;
the signora continued.</p>

<p>When I returned to my hotel
through the silent streets the <i>granatieri</i>
had gone from their post, but
the horsemen were still sitting their
sleeping mounts before the old
church. Their vigil would be all
night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The nation&rsquo;s crisis had come and
passed. We did not know it, but it
was marked by those little piles of
stones in the Via Viminale. The disturber
Giolitti had fled overnight at
the invitation of the government,
which now knew itself to be strong
enough to do what it would. And
thereafter events moved more swiftly.
Rome was once more calm. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>people gathered again by the hundreds
of thousands, but peacefully,
in the spirit of concord, in the Piazza
del Popolo and in the Campidoglio.
Their will had prevailed, they
had found themselves. A great need
of reconciliation, of union of all
spirits, was expressed in these meetings,
under the soft spring sky, in
spots consecrated by ancient memories
of greatness.</p>

<p>In the crowd that filled the little
piazza of the Campidoglio to the
brim and ran down into the old
lanes that led to the Forum and the
city I met Signora Maironi once
more. She had not come thither to
find her boy&mdash;soldiers were no longer
needed to keep the Romans from
violence. She came in the hungry
need to fill her heart with belief and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>confidence, to strengthen herself for
sacrifice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen Enrico since that
night on the streets. He is kept
ready in the barracks unless he has
been sent away already.... But he
said he would let us know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A procession with the flags of Italy
and of the desired provinces mounted
the long flight of steps above us,
and the syndic of Rome, the Prince
Colonna, came out from the open
door and fronted the mass of citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going, and his sons!&rdquo; the
signora whispered. &ldquo;He is a fine
man!&rdquo; The prince looked gravely
over the upturned faces as if he
would speak; then refrained, as
though the moment were too solemn
for further words. He stood there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>looking singularly like the grave
portraits of Roman fathers in the
museum near by, strong, stern, resolved.
The evening breeze lifted the
cluster of flags and waved them vigorously.
Little fleecy clouds floated
in the blue sky above the AracÅ“li
Church. There were no shouts, no
songs. These were men and women
from the working classes of the
neighboring quarter of old Rome
who were giving their sons and husbands
to the nation, and felt the solemnity
of the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; the Prince Colonna
said solemnly, &ldquo;to the Quirinal to
meet our King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we turned down the hill we
could see the long black stream already
flowing through the narrow
passages out into the square before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>the great marble monument. It was
a silent, spontaneous march of the
people to their leader. The blooming
roses in the windows and on the terraces
above gayly flamed against
the dark walls of the old houses
along the route. But the hurrying
crowd did not look up. Its mood was
sternly serious. It did not turn aside
as we neared the palace of the
enemy&rsquo;s ambassador. The time was
past for such childish demonstrations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only we might go instead, we
older ones,&rdquo; the signora said sadly,
&ldquo;not the children.... Life means so
much more to them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached the Quirinal hill as the
setting sun flooded all Rome from
the ridge of the Janiculum. The piazza
was already crowded and at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Consulta opposite the royal palace,
where, even at this eleventh hour,
the ambassadors were vainly offering
last inducements, favored spectators
filled the windows. It was a
peculiarly quiet, solemn scene. No
speeches, no cheers, no songs. It
seemed as if the signora&rsquo;s last words
were in every mind. &ldquo;They say,&rdquo;
she remarked sadly, &ldquo;that it will
take a great many lives to carry
those strong mountain positions,
many thousands each month, thousands
and thousands of boys....
All those mothers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the window on
the balcony above the entrance to
the palace was flung open, and two
lackeys brought out a red cloth
which they hung over the stone balustrade.
Then the King and Queen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>followed by the little prince and his
sister, stepped forth and stood above
us, looking down into the crowded
faces. The King bowed his head to
the cheers that greeted him from
his people, but his serious face did
not relax. He looked worn, old. Perhaps
he, too, was thinking of those
thousands of lives that must be
spent each month to unlock the Alpine
passes which for forty years
Austria had been fortifying!... He
bowed again in response to the
hearty cries of <i>Viva il Re!</i> The Queen
bowed. The little black-haired prince
by his father&rsquo;s side looked steadily
down into the faces. He, too, seemed
to understand what it meant&mdash;that
these days his father&rsquo;s throne had
been put into the stake for which
Italy was to fight, that his people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>had cast all on the throw of this war.
No smile, no boyish elation, relieved
the serious little face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does he not speak?&rdquo; the
signora murmured, as if her aching
heart demanded a word of courage
from her King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not yet the time,&rdquo; I suggested,
nodding to the Consulta.</p>

<p>The King cried, &ldquo;<i>Viva Italia!</i>&rdquo;
then withdrew from the balcony
with his family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Viva Italia!</i>&rdquo; It was a prayer, a
hope, spoken from the heart, and it
was received silently by the throng.
Yes, might the God of battles preserve
Italy, all the beauty and the
glory that the dying sun was bathing
in its golden flood!...</p>

<p>Signora Maironi hurried through
the crowded street at a nervous pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like to be long away
from home,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;&rsquo;Rico
may come and go for the last time
while I am out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had no sooner entered the door
of the house than the mother said:
&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was sitting in the little
dining-room, drinking a glass of
wine, his father on one side, his
sister on the other. He seemed much
excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We leave in the morning!&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>There was an exultant ring in his
voice, a flash in his black eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They never tell&mdash;to the front
somewhere!... See my stripes.
They have made me bicyclist for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>the battalion. I&rsquo;ve got a machine to
ride now. I shall carry orders, you
know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His laugh was broken by a cough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh, this nasty cold&mdash;that comes
from Messer Giolitti&mdash;too much
night-work&mdash;no more of that! The
rat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at the signora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you all his things ready,
Bianca?&rdquo; she asked calmly. &ldquo;The
cheese and the cake and his
clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; the little girl replied
quickly. &ldquo;&rsquo;Rico says we can&rsquo;t
come to see him off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother looked inquiringly at
the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use trying. Nobody knows
where or when,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t want a lot of mothers and sisters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>fussing over the men,&rdquo; he added
teasingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little Bianca told me how she and
her mother slipped past all the sentinels
at the station the next morning
and ran along the embankment
outside the railroad yards where the
long line of cattle-cars packed with
soldiers was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know us pretty well in the
regiment by this time,&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;I heard them say as we ran along
the cars looking for &rsquo;Rico, &lsquo;See!
There&rsquo;s Maironi&rsquo;s mother and the
little Maironi! Of course, they would
come somehow!&rsquo;... We gave them
the roses you brought yesterday&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t mind? They loved them
so&mdash;and said such nice things.&rdquo; Bianca
paused to laugh and blush at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>the pretty speeches which the soldiers
had made, then ran on: &ldquo;Poor
boys, they&rsquo;ll soon be where they
can&rsquo;t get flowers and cakes.... Then
we found &rsquo;Rico at last and gave him
the things just as the train started.
He was so glad to see us! Poor &rsquo;Rico
had such a cough, and he looked
quite badly; he doesn&rsquo;t know how
to take care of himself. Mother is
always scolding him for being so
careless&mdash;boys are all like that, you
know!... There was such a noise!
We ran along beside the train, oh, a
long way, until we came to a deep
ditch&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t jump that! And
they cheered us, all the soldiers in the
cars; they looked so queer, jammed
in the cattle-cars with the straw, just
like the horses. Enrico&rsquo;s captain gave
us a salute, too. I wonder where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>they are now.&rdquo; She paused in her
rapid talk for a sombre moment, then
began excitedly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want
to see my Red Cross dress? It&rsquo;s so
pretty! I have just got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ran up-stairs to put on her
nurse&rsquo;s uniform; presently the signora
came into the room. She was
dressed all in black and her face was
very pale. She nodded and spoke in
a dull, lifeless voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bianca told you? He wanted me
to thank you for the cigarettes. He
was not very well&mdash;he was suffering,
I could see that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing worse than a cold,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see him again!&rdquo; she cried
suddenly, passionately, &ldquo;just once,
once more&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice died
out in a whisper. Bianca, who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>come back in her little white dress,
took up the signora&rsquo;s unfinished sentence
with a frown:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, we shall see him again,
mamma! Didn&rsquo;t he promise to write
us where they sent him?&rdquo; She turned
to me, impetuous, demanding, true
little woman of her race. &ldquo;You know,
I shall go up north, too, to one of
the hospitals, and mamma will go
with me. Then we&rsquo;ll find Enrico.
Won&rsquo;t we, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the signora&rsquo;s miserable eyes
seemed far away, as if they were
following that slowly moving train
of cattle-cars packed with boyish
faces. She fingered unseeingly the
arm of Bianca&rsquo;s dress with its cross
of blood-red. At last, with a long
sigh, she brought herself back to
the present. Was I ready for an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>Italian lesson? We might as well
lose no more time. She patted Bianca
and pushed her gently away.
&ldquo;Run along and take off that terrible
dress!&rdquo; she said irritably. Bianca,
with a little, discontented gesture
and appreciative pat to the
folds of her neat costume, left us
alone. &ldquo;She thinks of nothing but
this war!&rdquo; the signora exclaimed.
&ldquo;The girls are as bad as the men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not quite natural?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We began on the verbs, but the
signora&rsquo;s mind, usually so vivacious,
was not on the lesson. It was still
with that slow troop-train on its
way to the frontier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too tired,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I can&rsquo;t stay in here&mdash;let
us go into the city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rome seemed curiously lifeless and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>dead after all the passionate movement
of the past week. It was empty,
too. All the troops that had filled
the seething streets had departed
overnight, and the turbulent citizens
had vanished. The city, like the
heart of Italy, was in suspense,
waiting for the final word which
meant war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not stay here much
longer, I suppose?&rdquo; the signora questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not.&rdquo; Life seemed to
have flowed out of this imperial
Rome, with all its loveliness, in the
wake of the troop-trains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only go, too!... If we
knew where he was to be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will know&mdash;and you will follow
with Bianca.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would go into battle itself to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>see &rsquo;Rico once more!&rdquo; the poor
woman moaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be lots of time yet before
the battles begin,&rdquo; I replied
with lying comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so!... War is very
terrible for those who have to stay
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>
</div>

<p>In obedience to Signora Maironi&rsquo;s
mysterious telegram, I waited outside
the railroad station in Venice
for the arrival of the night express
from Rome, which was very late. The
previous day I had taken the precaution
to attach to me old Giuseppe,
one of the two boatmen now
left at the <i>traghetto</i> near my hotel,
all the younger men having been
called out. There were few <i>forestieri</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>and Giuseppe was thankful to have
a real signore, whom he faithfully
protected from the suspicious and
hostile glances of the Venetians.
Every stranger, I found, had become
an Austrian spy! Giuseppe was
now busily tidying up his ancient
gondola, exchanging jokes with the
soldiers in the laden barks which
passed along the canal. Occasionally
a fast motor-boat threw up a long
wave as it dashed by on an errand
with some officer in the stern. All
Venice, relieved of tourists, was
bustling with soldiers and sailors.
Gray torpedo-boats lay about the
piazzetta, and Red Cross flags waved
from empty palaces. Yet there was
no war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Giuseppe,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;do you think
there will be any war?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sicuro!</i>&rdquo; the old man replied,
straightening himself and pointing
significantly with his thumb to a
passing bargeful of soldiers. &ldquo;They
are on the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows?... The mountains,&rdquo;
and he indicated the north with his
head. &ldquo;I have two sons&mdash;they have
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Italy will win?&rdquo; I continued
idly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sicuro!</i>&rdquo; came the reply reassuringly,
&ldquo;<i>ma!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in that expressive &ldquo;<i>ma</i>&rdquo; I
might read all the anxiety, the fears
of Italy.</p>

<p>At last the signora came, dressed
in the same black she had worn the
day Enrico had left Rome. In her
hand she carried a little bag. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>gave me a timid smile as Giuseppe
settled her under the <i>felza</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were surprised at the telegram?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; I confessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to come,&rdquo; she sighed as the
gondola pushed into the narrow, tortuous
canal that led back to the
piazza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news from Enrico?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing! Not a word!... That&rsquo;s
why I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a week&mdash;the mails
are slow,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could stand it no longer. You will
think me mad. I mean to find him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;-where?&rdquo; I demanded
in bewilderment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I must discover here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Venice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody must know! Oh, I see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>what you think&mdash;I am out of my
head.... Perhaps I am! Sitting there
in the house day after day thinking,
thinking&mdash;and the poor boy was so
miserable that last morning&mdash;he was
too sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you must have some plan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An officer on the train last night&mdash;a
major going up there to join his
regiment&mdash;he was very kind to me,
lent me his coat to keep me warm,
it was so cold. He is a well-known
doctor in Rome. Here, I have his
card in my sack somewhere.... He
says it&rsquo;s a matter of hours now before
they begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, in a pause, hoping
to bring the signora&rsquo;s mind back to
the starting-point. &ldquo;What has the
major to do with your finding Enrico?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me to inquire at Mestre
or here where Enrico&rsquo;s train had
been sent.... They wouldn&rsquo;t tell me
anything at the railroad station in
Mestre. So I must find out here,&rdquo;
she ended inconsequentially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here in Venice? But they won&rsquo;t
tell you a thing even if they know.
You had a better chance in Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they wouldn&rsquo;t tell his father&mdash;he
tried to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you couldn&rsquo;t get north of
Mestre. It&rsquo;s all military zone now,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she answered vacantly. &ldquo;I
had to come,&rdquo; she repeated like a
child, &ldquo;and I feel better already&mdash;I&rsquo;m
so much nearer him.... Don&rsquo;t
you really think I can get to see him
for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>I spent a futile hour, while Giuseppe
pushed us languidly through
the gray lagoons, trying to convince
Signora Maironi that her search for
the boy was worse than useless,
might easily land her in prison should
she attempt to penetrate the lines.
At the end she merely remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Rico expects me&mdash;he said that
last night,&mdash;&lsquo;You will come up north
to see me, mother, before war is declared.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereat I began again at the beginning
and tried more urgently to
distract the signora from her purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might be locked up as a
spy!&rdquo; I concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am an Italian woman&mdash;an
Italian mother!&rdquo; she cried indignantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Giuseppe nodded sympathetically
over his long sweep and murmured
something like &ldquo;<i>Ã‰vero!</i>&rdquo; It ended
by my asking the old fellow if he
knew where the office of the Venetian
commandant was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sicuro!</i>&rdquo; the old man laughed,
waving a hand negligently toward
the Zattere. So we headed there. I
thought that an hour or two spent
in vainly trying to see the busy
gentleman in command of Venice
would probably do more than anything
else to convince Signora Maironi
of the futility of her quest. As
I helped her to the quay from the
gondola in front of the old convent
which was now the military headquarters,
she said gently, apologetically:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so cross with me,
signor! Think merely that I am an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>old woman and a mother with a son
about to fight for his country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw her disappear within the gate
after being questioned by the sentinel;
then Giuseppe and I waited in
the shadow of an interned German
steamship&mdash;one, two, almost three
hours, until the sun had set the
marble front of the Ducal Palace
aflame with a flood of gold. Then I
heard Giuseppe murmuring triumphantly,
&ldquo;<i>Ecco! la signora!</i>&rdquo; The
little black figure was waiting for us
by the steps, a contented smile on
her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I been long?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference, if you have
found out something. Did you see
the commandant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded her head in a pleased
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I should never get to
him&mdash;there were so many officers
and sentinels, and they all tried to
turn me off. But I wouldn&rsquo;t go! It
takes a great deal to discourage a
mother who wants to see her son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he told you?&rdquo; I asked impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens, how lovely the day is!&rdquo;
the signora remarked with her provoking
inconsequentiality. &ldquo;Let us
go out to the Lido! Maybe we can
find a fisherman&rsquo;s osteria at San
Nicolo where we can get supper under
the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gondola headed seaward in the
golden light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a terrible war,&rdquo; the signora
began presently. &ldquo;They know
it.... The commandant talked with
me a long time after I got to him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>while others waited.... There are
many spies here in Venice, he told
me&mdash;Austrians who are hidden in
the city.... He was such a gentleman,
so patient with me and kind....
Do you know, I wept&mdash;yes, cried
like a great fool! When he told me
I must return and wait for news in
Rome, and I thought of that long
ride back without seeing my sick
boy&mdash;I just couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I cried....
He was very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end the facts came out, as
they always did with the signora,
in her own casual fashion. The military
commander of Venice, evidently,
was a kind, fatherly sort of officer,
with sons of his own in the army, as
he had told the signora. After giving
the distracted mother the only sound
advice he could give her&mdash;to resign
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>herself to waiting for news of her son
by the uncertain mails&mdash;he had let
fall significantly, &ldquo;But if you should
persist in your mad idea, signora, I
should take the train to &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and
he mentioned a little town near the
Austrian frontier not three hours&rsquo;
ride from Venice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; I asked as
we approached the shore of the Lido.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the signora sighed.
&ldquo;But I must see Enrico once more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Buon&rsquo; Pesche, a little osteria
near the waterside, was thronged
with sailors from the gray torpedo-boats
that kept up a restless activity,
dashing back and forth in the harbor
entrance. We found a table under a
plane-tree, a little apart from the
noisy sailors who were drinking to
the success of Italian arms in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>purple wine of Padua, and, while
the dusk fell over distant Venice,
watched the antics of the swift destroyers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they seem possessed!&rdquo; the
signora exclaimed. &ldquo;Like angry bees,
as if they knew the enemy was near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were speaking English, and I
noticed that the country girl who
served us looked at me sharply.
When we rose to leave it was already
dark, the stars were shining in the
velvet sky, and Venice was mysteriously
blank. As we strolled across
the grass toward the boat-landing,
a man stepped up and laid his hand
on my shoulder, indicating firmly
that I should accompany him. He
took us to the military post at the
end of the island, the signora expostulating
and explaining all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>way. There we had to wait in a bare
room faintly lighted by one flaring
candle while men came and went
outside, looked at us, talked in low
tones, and left us wondering. After
an hour of this a young officer appeared,
and with a smiling, nervous
air began a lengthy examination.
Who was I? Who was the signora&mdash;my
wife, my mother? Why were we
there on the Lido after dark, etc.?
It was easy enough to convince him
that I was what I was&mdash;an amicable,
idle American. My pocketful of
papers and, above all, my Italian,
rendered him quickly more smiling
and apologetic than ever. But the
signora, who, it seems, had not registered
on her arrival in Venice, as
they had ascertained while we were
waiting, was not so easily explained,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>although she told her tale truthfully,
tearfully, in evident trepidation. To
the young officer it was not credible
that an Italian mother should be
seeking her soldier son on the Lido
at this hour. Another officer was summoned,
and while the first young
man entertained me with appreciations
of English and American authors
with whose works he was acquainted,
the signora was put through
a gruelling examination which included
her ancestry, family affairs,
and political opinions. She was alternately
angry, haughty, and tearful,
repeating frequently, &ldquo;I am an
Italian mother!&rdquo; which did not answer
for a passport as well as my
broken Italian. In the end she had
to appeal to the kindly commandant
who had listened to her story earlier
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>in the day. After hearing the signora&rsquo;s
tearful voice over the telephone,
he instructed the youthful
captain of artillery to let us go. The
young officers, whose responsibilities
had weighed heavily on them, apologized
profusely, ending with the remark:
&ldquo;You know we are expecting
something to happen&mdash;very soon!...
We have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We hurried to the landing, where
we found Giuseppe fast asleep in the
gondola, but before we could rouse
him had some further difficulty with
suspicious <i>carabinieri</i>, who were inclined
to lock us up on the Lido until morning.
A few lire induced them
to consider our adventure more leniently,
and well past midnight the
sleepy Giuseppe swept us toward
the darkened city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You might think they were already
at war!&rdquo; I grumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are,&rdquo; the signora replied
sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see what trouble you
will get into if you attempt to enter
the war zone,&rdquo; I warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the subdued woman said
dully, &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That story of yours doesn&rsquo;t sound
probable&mdash;and you have no papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sighed heavily without reply,
but I thought it well to drive home
the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you had better take the train
home to-morrow and not get arrested
as a spy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several hours later I woke from a
dream with the song of a nightingale
in my ears mingled with a confused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>reverberation. It was not yet day;
in the pale light before dawn the
birds were wheeling and crying in
the little garden outside my room.
I stumbled to the balcony from which
I could see the round dome of the
Salute against the cloudless sky and
a streak of sunrise beyond the Giudecca.
What had cut short the song
of the nightingale? Suddenly the
answer came in the roar of an explosion
from somewhere within the
huddle of Venetian alleys, followed
by the prolonged shrieks of sirens
from the arsenal and the sputter
and crackle of countless guns. I did
not have to be told that this was
war! This was what those young
officers on the Lido were expecting
to happen before morning. Austria
had taken this way of acknowledging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>Italy&rsquo;s temerity in challenging
her might: she had sworn to destroy
the jewelled beauty of Venice, and
these bombs falling on the sleeping
city were the Austrian answer to
Italy&rsquo;s declaration of war!</p>

<p>Another and another explosion followed
in rapid succession, while the
sirens shrieked and the antiaircraft
guns from palace roofs rattled and
spluttered up and down the Grand
Canal. Then in a momentary lull I
could detect the low hum of a motor,
and looking upward I saw far aloft
in the gray heavens the enemy aeroplane
winging its way like some
malevolent beetle in a straight line
across the city. The little balconies
all about were crowded with people
who, unmindful of the warnings to
keep within doors, and as near the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>cellar as Venetian dwellings permitted,
were gazing like myself into
the clear heavens after the buzzing
machine. Their voices began to rise
in eager comment as soon as the
noise of bombs and guns died out.
I caught sight of Signora Maironi
in a group on a neighboring balcony,
looking fixedly at the vanishing
enemy.</p>

<p>Presently, as I was thinking that
the attack had passed, there came
again the peculiar hum of another
aeroplane from behind the hotel. It
grew louder and louder, and soon
came the roar of exploding bombs
followed by the crackle of answering
guns. One deafening roar went up
from the canal near by, echoing back
and forth between the palace walls.
That was very close, I judged! But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>the signora, as if fascinated, stood
there, gazing into space, waiting for
the evil machine to show itself.
Gradually the noise died down as
the aeroplane swung into view and
headed eastward like its mate for
the open Adriatic. A last, lingering
explosion came from the direction of
the arsenal, then all was silence except
for the twittering of the disturbed
birds in the garden and the
excited staccato voices of Venetians
telling one another what had happened.</p>

<p>Yes, this was war! And as I hurriedly
dressed myself I thought that
Signora Maironi would be lucky if
she got safely out of Venice back to
her home. We met over an early cup
of coffee. The signora, to my surprise,
did not seem in the least frightened&mdash;rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>she had been stirred
to a renewed determination by this
first touch of war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Return now without seeing my
boy!&rdquo; she said scornfully in reply
to my suggestion that we go at once
to the railroad station. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first attack,&rdquo; I protested,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t tell when they
will be at it again, perhaps in a few
hours.... It is very dangerous, signora!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no fear,&rdquo; she said simply,
conclusively.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So Giuseppe took her over to Mestre
in the gondola. I judged that it
would be safer for her to start on
her quest alone, depending solely on
her mother appeal to make her way
through the confusion at the front.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>She waved me a smiling farewell on
the steps of the old palace, her little
bag in one hand, looking like a comfortable
middle-aged matron on a
shopping expedition, not in the least
like a timid mother starting for the
battle line in search of her child.</p>

<p>And that was the last I saw of
Signora Maironi for four days. Ordinarily,
it would not take that many
hours to make the journey to X&mdash;&mdash;.
But these first days of war there
was no telling how long it might
take, nor whether one could get
there by any route. Had her resolution
failed her and had she already
returned to Rome? But in that case
she would surely have telegraphed.
Or was she detained in some frontier
village as a spy?...</p>

<p>The morning of the fifth day after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>the signora&rsquo;s departure I was dawdling
over my coffee in the deserted
<i>salone</i>, enjoying the scented June
breeze that came from the canal,
when I heard a light step and a
knock at the door. Signora Maironi
entered and dropped on a lounge,
very white and breathless, as if she
had run a long way from somewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me coffee, please! I have had
nothing to eat since yesterday morning.&rdquo;
And after she had swallowed
some of the coffee I poured for her
she began to speak, to tell her story,
not pausing to eat her roll.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;When I left you that morning&mdash;when
was it, a week or a year ago?&mdash;I
seemed very courageous, didn&rsquo;t
I? The firing, the danger, somehow
woke my spirit, made me brave. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>before I started I really wanted to
run back to Rome. Yes, if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for the idea of poor &rsquo;Rico up
there in that same danger, only worse,
I should never have had the courage
to do what I did.... Well, we got
to Mestre, as Giuseppe no doubt
told you. While I was waiting in the
station for the train to that place
the commandant told me, I saw a
young lieutenant in the grenadier
uniform. He was not of &rsquo;Rico&rsquo;s company
or I should have known him,
but he had the uniform. Of course
I asked him where he was going.
He said he didn&rsquo;t know, he was trying
to find out where the regiment
was. He had been given leave to go
to his home in Sardinia to bury his
father, poor boy, and was hurrying
back to join the grenadiers. &lsquo;If you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>will stay with me, signora,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;you will find where your boy is,
for you see I must join my regiment
at once.&rsquo; Wasn&rsquo;t that lucky for me?
So I got into the same compartment
with the lieutenant when the train
came along. It was full of officers.
But no one seemed to know where
the grenadiers had been sent. The
officers were very polite and kind
to me. They gave me something to
eat or I should have starved, for
there was nothing to be bought at
the stations, everything had been
eaten clean up as if the locusts had
passed that way!... There was one
old gentleman&mdash;here, I have his card
somewhere&mdash;well, no matter&mdash;we
talked a long time. He told me how
many difficulties the army had to
meet, especially with spies. It seems
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>that the spies are terrible. The Austrians
have them everywhere, and
many are Italians, alas! the ones
who live up there in the mountains!
They are arresting them all the
time. They took a woman and a
man in a woman&rsquo;s dress off the
train. Well, that didn&rsquo;t make me
any easier in my mind, but I stayed
close to my little lieutenant, who
looked after me as he would his own
mother, and no one bothered me
with questions....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such heat and such slowness!
You cannot imagine how weary I
became before the day was done.
Trains and trains of troops passed.
Poor fellows! And cannon and horses
and food, just one long train after
another. We could scarcely crawl....
So we reached X&mdash;&mdash; as it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>getting dark, but the <i>granatieri</i> were
not there. They had been the day
before, but had gone on forward
during the night. To think, if I had
started the night before I should
have found &rsquo;Rico and had him a
whole day perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; I remarked, as the
signora paused to swallow another
cup of coffee. &ldquo;It was all a matter
of chance, and if you had started
the day before you would have
missed your lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there was nothing for it
but to spend the night at X&mdash;&mdash;. For
no trains went on to Palma Nova,
where the lieutenant was going in
the morning. So I walked into the
town to look for a place to sleep,
but every bed was taken by the
officers, not a place to sleep in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>whole town. It was then after nine
o&rsquo;clock; I returned to the station,
thinking I could stay there until the
train started for Palma Nova. But
they won&rsquo;t even let you stay in
railroad stations any longer! So I
walked out to the garden in the
square and sat down on a bench to
spend the night there. Luckily it
was still warm. Who should come by
with an old lady on his arm but the
gentleman I had talked with on the
train, Count&mdash;yes, he was a count&mdash;and
his mother. They had a villa
near the town, it seems. &lsquo;Why, signora!&rsquo;
he said, when he saw me sitting
there all alone, &lsquo;why are you
out here at this time?&rsquo; And I told
him about there not being a bed
free in the town. Then he said: &lsquo;You
must stay with us. We have made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>our villa ready for the wounded, but,
thank God, they have not begun to
come in yet, so there are many
empty rooms at your disposal.&rsquo; That
was how I escaped spending the
night on a bench in the public garden!
It was a beautiful villa, with
grounds all about it&mdash;quite large.
They gave me a comfortable room
with a bath, and that was the last I
saw of the count and his mother&mdash;whatever
were their names. Early
the next morning a maid came with
my coffee and woke me so that I
might get the train for Palma Nova.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That day was too long to tell
about. I found my young lieutenant,
and as soon as we reached Palma
Nova he went off to hunt for the
<i>granatieri</i>. But the regiment had been
sent on ahead! Again I was just too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>late. It had left for the frontier,
which is only a few miles east of the
town. I could hear the big cannon
from there. (Oh, yes, they had begun!
I can tell you that made me all
the more anxious to hold my boy
once more in my arms.) Palma Nova
was jammed with everything, soldiers,
motor-trucks, cannon&mdash;such
confusion as you never saw. Everything
had to pass through an old
gate&mdash;you know, it was once a Roman
town and there are walls and
gates still standing. About that gate
toward the Austrian frontier there
was such a crush to get through as
I never saw anywhere!</p>

<p>&ldquo;They let no one through that
gate without a special pass. You see,
it was close to the lines, and they
were afraid of spies. I tried and tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>to slip through, but it was no use.
And the time was going by, and
Enrico marching away from me
always toward battle. I just prayed
to the Virgin to get me through that
gate&mdash;yes, I tell you, I prayed hard
as I never prayed before in my life....
The young lieutenant came to
tell me he had to go on to reach his
regiment and offered to take anything
I had for Enrico. So I gave
him almost all the money I had
with me, and the little watch you
gave me for him, and told him to say
I should get to him somehow if it
could be done. The young man
promised he would find &rsquo;Rico and
give him the things at the first opportunity.
How I hated to see him
disappear through that gate into
the crowd beyond! But there was no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>use trying: there were soldiers with
drawn bayonets all about it. My
prayers to the Virgin seemed to do
no good at all....</p>

<p>&ldquo;So at the end, after trying everywhere
to get that special pass, I was
sitting before a cafÃ© drinking some
milk&mdash;everything is so frightfully
dear, you have no idea!&mdash;and was
thinking that after coming so far I
was not to see my boy. For the first
time I felt discouraged, and I must
have shown it, too, with my eyes always
on that gate. An officer who was
waiting in front of the cafÃ©, walking
to and fro, presently came up to me
and said: &lsquo;Signora, I see that sorrow
in your eyes which compels me to
address you. Is there anything a
stranger might do to comfort you?&rsquo;
So I told him the whole story, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>he said very gently: &lsquo;I do not know
whether I can obtain the permission
for you, but I know the officer who
is in command here. Come with me
and we will tell him your desire to
see your son before the battle, which
cannot be far off, and perhaps he
will grant your request.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of such fortune! The Virgin
<i>had</i> listened. I shall always pray
with better faith after this! Just
when I was at the end, too! The kind
officer was also a count, Count Foscari,
from here in Venice. He has a
brother in the garrison here, and
there&rsquo;s a lady to whom he wishes me
to give some letters.... I wonder
if I still have them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The signora stopped to investigate
the recesses of her little bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, let me know what the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>Count Foscari did for you,&rdquo; I exclaimed,
tantalized by the signora&rsquo;s
discursive narrative. &ldquo;Then we can
look after his correspondence at our
leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they are!... He took me
with him to the office of the military
commander of the town&mdash;a very
busy place it was. But the count just
walked past all the sentinels, and I
followed him without being stopped.
But when he asked for the pass
the commander was very cross and
answered, &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo;&mdash;short like
that. Even while we were there,
another, stronger order came over
the telegraph from the staff forbidding
any civilian to pass through
the town. I thought again it was all
over&mdash;I should never see &rsquo;Rico. But
Count Foscari did not give up. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>just waited until the commander had
said everything, then spoke very
gently to him in a low tone (but I
could hear). &lsquo;The signora is an
Italian mother. I will give my word
for that! She wants to see her son,
who was sick when he left Rome.&rsquo;
Then he stopped, but the other officer
just frowned, and the count tried
again. &lsquo;It is not much good that
any of us can do now in this life.
We are all so near death that it
seems we should do whatever kindness
we can to one another.&rsquo; He
looked at me more gently, but said
nothing. The commandant&rsquo;s secretary
was there with the pass already
made out in his hand&mdash;he had been
preparing it while the others were
talking&mdash;and he put it down on the
table before the officer for his signature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>That one turned his head, then
the count gave a nod to the secretary,
and the kind young man took
the seal and stamped it and handed
it to me with a little smile. And the
commandant just shrugged his shoulders
and pretended not to see. The
count said to him: &lsquo;Thanks! For a
mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there I was with my pass. I
thanked Count Foscari and hurried
through that gate as fast as my legs
would carry me, afraid that some
one might take the paper away from
me. What an awful jam there was!
I thought my legs would not hold
out long on that hard road, but I
was determined to walk until I fell
before giving up now.... I must
have passed forty sentinels; some of
them stopped me. They said I would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>be shot, but what did I care for that!
I could hear the roaring of the guns
ahead, louder all the time, and the
smoke. It was really battle. I began
to run. I was so anxious lest I might
not have time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you not afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what? Of a shell hitting my
poor old body? I never thought of
it. I just felt&mdash;little &rsquo;Rico is on there
ahead in the middle of all that. But
it was beautiful all the same&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
she repeated softly, with a strange
gleam on her tired face, &ldquo;it was
<i>beau</i> and horrible at the same time....
I passed the frontier stones.
Yes! I have been on Austrian territory,
though it&rsquo;s no longer Austrian
now, God be praised! I was
very nearly in Gradesca, where the
battle was. I should never have gotten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>that far had it not been for a
kind officer in a motor-car who took
me off the road with him. How we
drove in all that muddle! He stopped
when we passed any troops to let
me ask where the <i>granatieri</i> were.
It was always &lsquo;just ahead.&rsquo; The
sound of the guns got louder.... I
was terribly excited and so afraid
I was too late, when suddenly I
saw a soldier bent over a bicycle riding
back down the road like mad.
It was my &rsquo;Rico coming to find me!...
I jumped out of the motor and
took him in my arms, there beside
the road.... God, how he had
changed already, how thin and old
his face was! And he was so excited
he could hardly speak, just like
&rsquo;Rico always, when anything is going
on. &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I wanted so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>to see you. You told me you might
come up here, and I looked for you
all along where the train stopped,
at Bologna and Mestre and Palma
Nova. But I couldn&rsquo;t find you. This
morning I knew you would come&mdash;I
knew it when I woke.&rsquo; (Don&rsquo;t you
see I was right in keeping on?)...
The young lieutenant had told &rsquo;Rico
I was looking for him, and they let
him come back on his bicycle to find
me. Poor boy, he was so excited and
kept glancing over his shoulder after
his regiment! &lsquo;You see, mamma,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;this is a real battle! We are
at the front! And our regiment has
the honor to make the first attack!&rsquo;
He was so proud, the poor boy!...
Of course I could not keep him long&mdash;five
minutes at the most I had
with him there by the side of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>highroad, with all the noise of the
guns and the passing wagons. Five
minutes, but I would rather have
died than lost those minutes.... I
put your watch on his wrist. He was
so pleased to have it, with the illuminated
hands which will give him the
time at night when he is on duty.
He wrote you a few words on this
scrap of paper, all I had with me,
leaning on my knee. I took his old
watch&mdash;the father will want it. It
had been next his heart and was still
warm.... Then he kissed me and
rode back up the road as fast as he
could go. The last I saw was when
he rode into a cloud of dust....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the signora concluded, after
a long pause, &ldquo;that is all! I found
my way back here somehow. I have
been through the lines, on Austrian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>territory, almost in battle itself&mdash;and
I have seen my boy again, the
Virgin be praised! And I am content.
Now let God do with him what
he will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later we went in search of Count
Foscari&rsquo;s brother and the lady to
whom he had sent his letters. Then
Giuseppe and I took the signora to
the train for Rome. As I stood beside
the compartment, the signora,
who seemed calmer, more like herself
than for the past fortnight, repeated
dreamily: &ldquo;My friend, I have
seen &rsquo;Rico again, and I am content.
Perhaps it is the last time I shall
have him in my arms, unless the
dear God spares him. And I know
now what it is he is doing for his country,
what battle is! He is fighting for
me, for all of us. I am content!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>With a gentle smile the signora
waved me farewell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Enrico came out of that first battle
safely, and many others, as little Bianca
wrote me. She and the signora
were making bandages and feeding
their thirsty hearts on the reports of
the brave deeds that the Italian troops
were doing along the Isonzo. &ldquo;They
are all heroes!&rdquo; the girl wrote. &ldquo;But
it is very hard for them to pierce
those mountains which the Austrians
have been fortifying all these years.
There is perpetual fighting, but Enrico
is well and happy, fighting for
Italy. Yesterday we had a postal
from him: he sent his respects to
you....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereafter, there was no news from
the Maironis for many weeks; then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>in the autumn came the dreaded
black-bordered letter in the signora&rsquo;s
childish hand. It was dated from
some little town in the north of
Italy and written in pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been in bed for a long
time, or I should have written before.
Our dear Enrico fell the 3d of
August on the Col di Lana. He died
fighting for Italy like a brave man,
his captain wrote.... Bianca is here
nursing me, but soon she will go
back to Padua into the hospital,
and I shall go with her if there is
anything that a poor old woman can
do for our wounded soldiers....
Dear friend, I am so glad that I
saw him once more&mdash;now I must
wait until paradise....&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
